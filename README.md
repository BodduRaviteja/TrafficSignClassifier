Project Name: Trafficsign Classification

It is basically a MulticlassClassification with Neural network. This Project is created in PyCharm IDE using Tensorflow-Keras framework. I have architectural reference of LeNet CNN and fine tuned for good accuracy

The workflow follows:
1. Importing required Modules 
2. Git cloning of Data
3. Unpacking of data
4. Data pre-processing and Augmentation 
5. Model Definition
6. Model Score Evaluation
7. Model testing
